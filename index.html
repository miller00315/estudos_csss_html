            <p>The release of Apple Silicon-based Macs at the end of last year generated a flurry of news coverage and
                some
                surprises at the machine’s performance. This post details some background information on the experience
                of
                porting
                Firefox to run natively on these CPUs.</p>
            <p>We’ll start with some background on the Mac transition and give an overview of Firefox internals that
                needed
                to know
                about the new architecture, before moving on to the concept of Universal Binaries.</p>
            <p>We’ll then explain how DRM/EME works on the new platform, talk about our experience with macOS Big Sur,
                and
                discuss
                various updater problems we had to deal with. We’ll conclude with the release and an overview of various
                other
                improvements that are in the pipeline.</p>

                        sharing; they are meant for not only one set of bikes, but at least a dozen of them. This

                        the
                        moment, he can use it
                        all for himself.</p>
